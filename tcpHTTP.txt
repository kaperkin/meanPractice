TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
-Operates at higher level than IP (Internest Protocol)
-Main concerns of TCP are two end systems: 
	- a web browser
	-a web server
-Provides delivery of bytes from a program from one computrer to another computer	
-Controls size, flowc ontrol, rate of data exchange and network traffic congestion

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
-Is an Application Layer Protocol
	-catagorizes other protocols and methods in the arhitectual models of computer networking
-Commonly found in client server computing
		-web browsers serve as the client
		-application running on the computer and hosting the web site serves as the server
		
DIFFERENCES
-TCP works between the IP and the application program
-HTTP works at the application level

-HTTP session is a sequence of request/response transactions that occur on the network
	-HTTP opens a TCP and then 'listens' on it

TCP-IP is basis of Internet and many other networks
HTTP runs on top of TCP, which runs on top of IP

SUMMARY

HTTP sessions open a TCP and listens in on it. TCP connects between the client and the Internet Protocol(IP). HTTP is an Application Layer Protocol; it makes a series of requests on the network.

HTTP > TCP > IP
