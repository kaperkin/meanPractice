Node TCP Server Basics and Echo Server
-TCP servers are created in Node by using the module 'net'

CODE EXAMPLE

var tcp = net.createServer(function(socket){});

-Socket takes the place of request and response. 
	-reading from socket you are reading from the client
	-writing to socket writes to the client
	-socket is bi-directional
	
	CODE EXAMPLE
		
		//create net server with callback 
		net.createServer(function(socket){
			//socket from client on data event	
			socket.on('data', function(data){
				//sock to client write the data
				socket.write('Server Reply: ' + data);
			})
		})

-When the server receives a request, it calls the callback function

-Socket is an EventEmitter
		-can listen for an event
			-such as socket.on('error', console.error);
