JavaScript Object Notation
JSON
sped: json.org

-composed of key-value pairs
-keys must be strings
-keys and values separated by a colon
-fields are separated with comma

fields can be:
	-string
	-number
		-there is no separate interger type, cannot distinguish beween ints and floats
	-booleon
	-object
	-array
	
	-does NOT support dates, need to endcode as string or in nested object
	
Fields can be nested probably as much as we want to	


Binary JSON
BSON
Spec: bson.org

-MongoDB stores data as BSON
-MongoDB drivers send and recieve data as BSON
-On app side, the Driver willmap BSON to the native data type of the app, in node's case: JSON

Designed to be:
	-lightweight
		-space required to store data is kept to minimun
	-traversable
		-supports the variety of operations necessary for readng, writing, and indexing documents
	-efficient
		- encoding and decoding from BSON can be perfomed quickly
		
BSON extends JSON value types to include intergers, doubles, dates, binary data	for img, etc.

BSON data includes:
	-length of doc
	-type of value
	-length of field value
	-null terminators for strings
