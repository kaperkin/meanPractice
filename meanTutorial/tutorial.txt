-Main file is server.js
    -this is the main file for Node app
        Where we will:
            -configure the application
            -connect to the database
            -create Mongoose models
            -Define routes for the RESTful API
            -Define routes for the frontend Angular application
            - Set the app to listen on a port so we can view it in the browser


Database
-this tutorial uses a remote database hosted on Modulus.io
-modulus provides a url to the database
    Connect to it through the command mongoose.connect(<URL from modulus goes here>)

Step 1:
    Create our Node API
        It will:
            -get all todos
            -create a todo
            -complete and delete todo
    Todo Model
            Uses Mongoose
            Mongoose creates models to interact with Database, like models.py
            Mongo will automatically generate an _id for each todo that we create

    RESTful API Routes
        -Express routes will handle API calls
        -routes make clls to the Database

       HTTP Verb 	URL 	                Description
        GET 	    /api/todos 	            Get all of the todos
        POST 	    /api/todos 	            Create a single todo
        DELETE 	    /api/todos/:todo_id 	Delete a single todo

    -Inside of the API routes, it uses the Mongoose actions to interact with our database

FRONTEND
        will be defined in index.html and core.js

In core.js, set the angular part of the program
The controller contains functions to:
    -get all todos
    -create a todo
    -delete a todo

HTML will need to interact with Angular:
    - assign Angular module and controller
    -initialize the page by getting all todos
    -loop over the todos
    -have a form to create todos
    -delete todos when they are checked
