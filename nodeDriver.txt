MongoDB Nodejs Driver

What is a driver?

	-a library in a specific language that communicates with the database

MongoDB module is a dependency in Node
	-need to install in as a depenedency even if it's installed globally 
		-it's okay if it throws an error

Mongo shell is synchronous, but driver is async

Node js and CRUD Interface
	In the Node driver you must require the MongoClient
		- var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
		-var assert = require('assert');
		
	Connect to Mongo Client
			-MongoClient.connect('<url of db>', function(err, db){
					<callback function>
				})
				- url of video db would be 'mongodb://localhost:27017/video'
				-27017 is port number mongo runs at
	
	Node will use a cursor to call to MongoDB

		allows you to inculde or exclude fields
		{'field': 1(toInclude), 'field2': 0(toExclude)}
