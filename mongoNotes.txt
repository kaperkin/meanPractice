to connect to the db shell

systemctl status mongod.service
systemctl disable mongod.service
^ that prevents it from coming up on boot

I made you a new db called toaster_bunny
*-:3

TO ACCESS MONGO:

				-posts collection
				-posts Document
			-db.<collection>.insertOne({JSON Object})
				-to insert one document	
			-db.<collection>.insertMany([{}, {}, {}]);
				-insert an array of documents/objects
				-optional secont argument of {'ordered:' false} to make sure it inserts all docs other than error docs
			-as soon as Mongo encounters an error, it will stop what it was doing, such as encountering duplicate id values	
			-db.<collection>.update()
			
			READING DOCUMENTS
				-db.<coll>.find({field: 'key you want'})
				-db.<coll>.find({field: 'key you want', field2: 'key2 you want to further limit'})
				
				Nested Documents
					-db.<coll>.find({"field.subfield": 'key in subfield'})
						-must wrap field in quotes
						-can go as deep as you like
				
				Array Fields
					can match on:
						-entire array
						-any element
						-specific element
						-more complex matches using operators
						
					exact match
						-db.<coll>.find({"field": ['thing1', 'thing2']})
							-must be in order
					single element
						-db.<coll>.find({"field": 'thing1'})
						
					specific position
						-db.<coll>.find(('arrayField.<index>': "Jeff Bridges"))
						
				Comparison Operator
					-match on basis of a field's value as compared to another value
					Operators:
						$gt 	:greater than
							db.<coll>.find({field: {$gt: <value>}})
						$exists :matches if it has the field
							db.<coll>.find({field: {$exists: true or false}})
						$type	:selects if field is of a certain type
							db.<coll>.find({field: {$type: 'type of thing you want' }})
				
				Logical Operators
					$or		:joins query clauses with logical 'or'
						-Takes an array of args as arg
						db.<coll>.find({$or: [<array of obj args>]})
					$and	:joins query clauses with logical 'and'
						-generally don't need to use this as you can use query operator
						-used when need to specify multiple criteria on same field
					$not	:joins query clauses with logical 'not'
					$nor	:joins query clauses with logical 'nor' returns docthat fail to match both
						
				Regex Operator
					-used to match fields with string values
					db.<coll>.find({'field to match': {$regex: /regexhere/}})
					
				Array Operators
					-designed to work with arrays
					$all	:matches arrays that contain all ements specified in the array
						db.<coll>.find({'fieldToMatch': {$all: ['condition', 'condition', 'condition']}})
					$elemMatch	:selects docs if elements in the array field match all of the $elemMatch conditions
						db.<coll>.find({'fieldWithArray': {$elemMatch{things to match within the element of the array}}})
					$size	:selects docs if the array field is specified size
						db.<coll>.find({'fieldToMatch': {$size: number}})
				Cursor
					.find() will iterate through data and display a certain amount. 
					
				Projection
					reducing size of data returned
					to limit amount of data Mongo sends:
							supplied as second argument to find command
					db.<coll>.find({fieldSearch: 'key'}, {'field you want to display (or not) on return': <1 for true, 0 for false-don't display>})

				$max
				$currentDate
			updateOne()
				-to add new field or update existing doc to existing operator:
					({fieldToFindDoc: value}, {$set: {newField: value}})
			updateMany()
				-will make updates to all docs that match filter
					updateMany({field: value}, {operator: {field: value}})
			replaceOne()
				-filter, and will replace doc with new doc	
			upsert
				If Mongo doesn't find the field you query for it will create it. This is called 'upserting'
				Can avoid this with param {upsert: false}		
				
				
		COLLECTIONS

				-db.<collection name>.find().pretty()
					-will prettify the JSON-type object
		
		Save Documents as vars
			- var post = db.posts.find()[1]
				-saves 2nd post as var post
			-can then access fields using dot notation
				-post.<field name>
				
		-db.collection.count()
			- returns the number of documents in a collection		
					
			

MONGO BASICS (Treehouse)

What Mongo is:
	-a NoSQL database
	-Not Only SQL
	
	Differences between SQL and NoSQL
		-SQL stores data in tables and has schema (relational?)
		-NoSQL stores data in a variety of formats and are less bound to schema controls.
		
		-SQL have standard (mostly) unified language that they are named for 
			-Structured Query Language
	
	Reasons to use Mongo
		- Makes development fast because it does not have a schema
		-easy to change and maintain because you don't have to migrate the schema
		-syntatically simple query language is easy to use because it looks more like a functional programming language than a query language
		-rapidly and widely adopted
		-can store read and write operations across many machines

Mongo Documents:
	-Documents are unique records in Mongo
		-A lot like JSON objects
		
		EXAMPLE:
			{_id: 53467289402,
			firstname: "Richard",
			lastname: "Feynman"}
			
			-Mongo will create _id when you create a Document
			- the _id is how the Document will be uniquelly identified
		
		-_id value is special type called ObjectId()
		-other fields can store many types of values including:
				-numbers
				-dates
				-arrays
				-objects
				-strings
				-Boolean
				-references to other documents

			EXAPMLE:
			
			{
			_id: 53467289402,
			name: {
				first: "Richard", 
				last: "Feynman"
				},
			signupDate: ISODate('2015-10-31TOO: 00:00:00Z'),
			roles: ['user', 'admin']
			}
			
Default location for Mongo to store data is /data/db	

Data Model
-Documents and individual records
-Colections are multiple organized Documents
	-such as a 'users' collection or 'blog posts' collection
	-collections organize documents similarly to tables, with each document being a row
		-if a column (field) is missing from a document (row), you don't have to do anything special
			-in relational databases you wouyld have to provide a default of null
			
To load files into Mongo DB
-Enter mongo shell
-load('<path to file>')
	-should return true

Collections
	-how you organize and catagorize documents in MongoDB
	-db.<collection name>.getCollectionNames()
		-will show the current collections in the database
		- useful for exploring dbs
	-db.<collection name>.getIndexes()
		-ability to see indexes on a collection
		-Mongo creates indexes by id to facilitate quick lookup 	
	-db.<collection name>.createIndex({<key>: 1 or -1}, {<options>})
		-value of one in key will put docs in ascending order
			- -1 will put in descending order
			-this matters in queries where multiple index queries are used to perfom a look-up
				-called Compound Queries
	-db.<collection name>.dropIndex('<index name>')
		-will delete index
		-unable to delete _id_ index
				
Queries
	-how you query data will determine how you choose to model and store it
	
	-db.<collection>.findOne({})
		-returns one document
	-db.<collections>.find({}, {<projections>})	
		-projections are objects where keys are fields to be returned and the values are Booleans of whether they should be returned
			EXAMPLE:
				- db.<collection>.find({}, {<value I Don't Want>: false})
		-If I only want one certain fields
			EXAMPLE:
				- db.<collections>.find({}, {<value I Want>: true})
		-will always return _id_ as well unless told not to
	-db.<collection>.find({<field>: 'value'})
		-will the whole object if there is a match, otherwise nothing
		
	Query Operator
		
	- db.<collection>.find({$or: [{name: "sue"}, {name: "bob"}]}, {<projections>})
		-takes and array of the options
		- this would return sue and/or bob doc		
				
Updating Data in the Mongo Shell
To spruce up mongo shell with highlighting:
	-npm install -g mongo-hacker
		-it will show version of db, db in use and syntax highlighting
	
	Update Docs:
		-db.<collection>.update({})
			-starts as simple query
			-db.<collection>.update({field: value to find}, {operator $set: {<new or updated field>: <value>, <new or updated field>: <value>}})
				-will show num of docs matching query and num of docs updated by query
	Upsert			
		If a document is not found with the query, a new one will be created with the parameters. This is called Upserting		
	
Chaining and Advanced methods
	-can chain methods such as db.<collection>.find({}, {<key>: boolean}).limit(num)
		-this will only return a num of docs that have the <key>	
	
	-Object.keys(db.<collection>.find()[0])
		-to see the fields in the  first doc
		
	-db.<collections>.sort({<field>: 1 or -1})
			-will sort in ascending (1) or descending (-1) order
Pagination:
	- means you display a set of results across different pages
		-EXAMPLE Portland Switchborad
	FIRST:
		-db.<collection>.limit(num)
	THEN:
		-db.<collection>.limit(num).skip(sameNumAsTop)
	-will skip the first two results and return the next two		
	
	
	Pagination formula: limit = number of records on each page, skip = number of records on each page * page number - 1

	So, with 5 results per page:
	page 1: limit = 5, skip = 0
	page 2: limit = 5, skip = 5
	page 3: limit = 5, skip = 10
	etc...

Language Drivers
-listed in documentation: https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/
-AKA: clients, libraries, plugins, bindings
-allow you to work with Mongo through language of choice
-Use to build applications that use Mongo
	-Nodejs commonly uses Mongoose
	
Sharding
-As the db grows, will need to store data across multiple machines
	-called Sharding or Horizontal Scaling
Reasons to Shard:
	-too much data for one machine
	-so multiple databases can handle requests to read and write data
-can store portions of db 
	
-MongoDB also introduces the concept of sharding, which makes it possible to scale the database horizontally as well as vertically. If the application owner needs to increase the database capabilities, they could add up more machines into the stack. This is a cheaper option compared to investing on RAM of a single machine, whichwill be the case in RDBMS (SQL) solutions.
	
	
BUILDING AN APP IN MONGODB
	Overview
	clients make requests to app
	app will be running nodejs
		-nodejs is c++ running v8 JS
	app will make request to MongoDB
	MongoDB will respond with write concern
		-mongodb is written in c++ as well
	Mongo shell can be used to admin tasks
		-also built with c++ on v8
	
	Mongo Shell is administratice interface
	MongoDB-App-Client is production interface
	 		
	Nodejs interacts with MongoDB through Language driver API
	
OBJECT _ID FIELD
	-creates _id by default
	-How object id is constructed
		- ObjectID:(date)(machine identifier)(ProcessID)(Counter to ensure id is unique)
